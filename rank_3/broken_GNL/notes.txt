1) fix header:
	#ifndef GET_NEXT_LINE_H
		# define GET_NEXT_LINE_H
2) include all necessary libraries (compiling errors will tell you which ones, or man pages)
	<limits.h>
	<fcntl.h>
	etc
3) somethig's up with the string initialization in gnl function. always segfaults. i re-wrote strchr.
4) there's an "s1" being passed around that is a char**. why? 
5) are str_append_str and str_append_mem both necessary?
